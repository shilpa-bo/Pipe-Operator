## Pipe Up

This program mimics the behavior of the pipe (|) operator in shells. 

## Building

To build this program, run the command `make`

## Running
To simulate the behavior of the shell command `ls | wc | sort`, execute `./pipe` with the following commands: `./pipe ls wc sort`. The expected output is the same as directly piping these commands in the shell. 

## Cleaning up
To clean up all binary files, run the command `make clean`
